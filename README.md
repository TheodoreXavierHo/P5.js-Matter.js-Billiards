Snooker Game Using p5.js and Matter.js
This program simulates a snooker game using p5.js for rendering and Matter.js for physics.

Commentary on the Snooker Game App

Developing a Snooker Experience: Developing a snooker game using p5.js and Matter.js has been an insightful journey into the intricacies of game 
development and physics simulation. My approach was driven by a desire to blend simplicity with interactivity, ensuring that the app remains 
user-friendly while offering a relatively realistic snooker-playing experience.

Cue Interaction Design: I opted for a mouse-based cue control system for its intuitive nature. This choice aligns with the interface design of other 
snooker/billiard/pool apps observed in the real world, where the mouse serves as a primary control device. The mechanism is straightforward: the 
player moves the mouse to adjust the cue angle and clicks to strike the cue ball. This design allows for precise control over the cue's angle and 
force, essential for a game that hinges on accuracy.

Table and Ball Physics: The snooker table and balls are rendered using p5.js, adhering to project requirements. The physics, including collisions, 
bouncing, and friction, are simulated with Matter.js. This framework offers a realistic physics engine, key to mimicking the snooker game's intricate 
dynamics. The movement of the balls on the table closely resembles real-life physics, from the spin after being struck to their bounce off the 
cushions.

Weather Effects: A unique extension in my game is the introduction of dynamic weather effects, namely wind and rain. These elements are not mere 
visual enhancements but also gameplay modifiers. The wind slightly alters the balls' trajectory, adding unpredictability, while rain, shown as 
falling particles, enriches the immersive experience without impacting ball physics. These effects are engaged through a specific game mode, 
diversifying the playing conditions and elevating the traditional snooker game into a more challenging and engaging experience.

Uniqueness of the Concept: Incorporating weather elements into a snooker game is both unorthodox and unprecedented, as standard snooker games are 
typically set indoors, devoid of external environmental influences. This creative twist adds a novel layer of challenge and demonstrates the 
potential of merging traditional game elements with imaginative and innovative features, pushing the boundaries of conventional game design.

Conclusion: My snooker game app represents a blend of traditional game mechanics with unique, unorthodox features. The mouse-based cue system 
underscores user-friendliness and precision, while the innovative weather effects reflect creative thinking in game design. This project served as a 
valuable learning lesson for game development and physics simulation and an opportunity to explore the limitless creative possibilities within 
computer science.
